# OOPs-Concept-in-Python

Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications.By understanding the core OOP principles—classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction—programmers can leverage the full potential of Python’s OOP capabilities to design elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems.

What is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?

In Python object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of object-oriented Programming (OOPs) or oops concepts in Python is to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

OOPs Concepts in Python::
 Class in Python
 Objects in Python
 Polymorphism in Python
 Encapsulation in Python
 Inheritance in Python
 Data Abstraction in Python

 What are the 4 pillars of OOP Python?
 
The 4 pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python (and generally in programming) are:

Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).

Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and providing a simplified interface.

Inheritance: Allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

Polymorphism: Using a single interface to represent different data types or objects.
